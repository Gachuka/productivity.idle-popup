# Productivity.Idle

This is a gamified productivity tracker built into a chrome extension. You collect "typed characters" as you type on your keyboard to use as currency to by upgrades to earn "typed characters" even faster!

The game runs in the background so you can collect "typed characters" in which ever tab you are currently using as long as it is in focus (being used).

You can also click on the chrome extension icon of Productivity.Idle to view your current progress, buy upgrades and have a look at your overall stats.
